# node-farm

This project is a backend application using node js.
The application is a farm and it is fully functional
The frontend wasn't designed by my goal was to get practice working on the backend of the application.

How to use:

1. Pick any code editor you like
2. Open node farm folder to the node-farm app
3. Open terminal and type node index.js
4. When you see the port 8000 then go to web browser and type in http://localhost:8000/
